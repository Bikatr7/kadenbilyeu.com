                My name is Kaden Bilyeu, I often go by the pseudonym Bikatr7. I'm a junior at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS) studying Computer Science with a focus in Cybersecurity and a minor in Japanese.

                I'm currently 20 years old and I've been programming since I was 10, nowadays my coding is mostly focused on exploring LLMs, NER/NLP, and other AI/ML technologies. I also make tools to assist with my Japanese learning and translation hobby.

                I'm a big fan of open-source software and I try to contribute to projects and make my own whenever possible. As for hobbies outside of coding, I really enjoy biking, learning and translating Japanese, and reading.
