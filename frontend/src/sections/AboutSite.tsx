                This site was designed with the purpose to replace my old site <Link href="https://bikatr7.github.io" color={"gray.300"} _hover={{ color: "yellow" }} isExternal>bikatr7.github.io</Link> (it's a redirect now so take a look at the <Link href="https://github.com/Bikatr7/bikatr7.github.io" color={"gray.300"} _hover={{ color: "yellow" }} isExternal>GitHub Repository</Link>), which was a simple HTML/CSS/JS site. Frankly, it looked terrible, but it was my first exploration into web development.

                Thankfully, after a few months and making a site for my LLC (<Link href="https://kakusui.org" color={"gray.300"} _hover={{ color: "yellow" }} isExternal>kakusui.org</Link> btw for those interested), I learned a lot about React and proper web design. This site is the result of that learning and I'm quite proud of it.

                So this one is made with Vite and React. A nice and simple one page site that I can easily update and maintain.
